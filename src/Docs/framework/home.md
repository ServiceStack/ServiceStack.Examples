# Welcome to the ServiceStack wiki!

Here you will find some documentations, articles, tutorials and other anecdotes on the ServiceStack Web Service Framework!

Note: We're aware that documentation is a little sparse at the moment however it will be a top priority in the near future so be sure to check back soon!

In the meantime we welcome you to look at the [Example projects](~/examples/servicestack-examples) to see how to quickly and easily build web services with ServiceStack. It is a conscience design decision to not to require any configuration and that the out-of-the-box installation is as useful as possible so it should be fairly easy to get started.

## Getting Started
1. View the [Hello World tutorial](http://www.servicestack.net/ServiceStack.Hello/) to see how to create a web service from scratch
2. The [MonoTouch Tutorial](http://www.servicestack.net/monotouch/remote-info/) is another geared towards calling web services from MonoTouch however the content should equally apply in most C# apps.
